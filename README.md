# Query Answering and Summarization with Semantic Search
This project is designed to answer queries based on a `MS MARCO` dataset using semantic search, relevant sentence extraction, and text summarization. The system is capable of answering both user input queries and dataset queries by.

## ðŸ§¸How It Works
1. **Semantic Search**: `sentence-transformers`

    When a query is entered (either from the user or pre-defined in the dataset), the system generates embeddings for the query and passages and searches the dataset to find the most relevant passage.

2. **Sentence Extraction**: 
    - The selected passage is split into individual sentences using `nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize`.
    - After finding the passage, the system extracts the most relevant sentence using similarity measures between the query embedding and sentence embeddings in the passage.

3. **Summarization**: `pipeline('summarization')`

    The extracted relevant sentence is then summarized using a pre-trained summarization model to provide a concise answer.

4. **Result Display**: 
    
    The query, best sentences, summarized text, and similarity score between the query and the passage are displayed in a user-friendly format (i.e., pandas DataFrame).
